## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We aligned quickly on scope and value: “ingredients ➜ ai” solves a real problem for busy students. We finalized a clean feature list (6+ items) and tagged two custom features (Recipe generation + saved recipies). The team agreed on tech choices (React + Express + Postgres + Gemini ai API), sketched the schema, and set up the repo. Collaboration also went smoothly—we split tasks evenly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Scoping AI behavior was tricky (prompt design, consistent structure in outputs). We debated how much to store + video. we debated about using images and additional storage but opted against. We also called out likely friction points: API rate limits/costs of free model, and keeping UX simple while adding power features like comments and transitions.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Guidance on best-practice examples for streaming AI responses, and suggestions for collaborating on Github. We’d also benefit from examples of secure key management on Render and deploying.
